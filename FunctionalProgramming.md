# Functional Programming in Java and Swift
Java, born as a pure object oriented language, lacked functional programming abilities until recently. Java 8 has joined in on the functional programming craze but it still has some kinks to work out. Swift was born a multi-paradigm language and has a rich set of functional programming abilities right out of the box. To really get a feel for how these languages differ, we will look at a few core concepts of functional programming, namely:
1. First class functions
2. Higher Order Functions (functions that can take other functions as input or return functions as output)
3. Immutable data
