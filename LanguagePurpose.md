# Language Purpose and Genesis

## Java

Introduced in 1996 by Sun Microsystem, Inc, headed by James Gosling, Java's purpose was to be a new language that would allow consumer
electronic devices to communicate with each other.  The primary goal of the creators of Java was to create a language that could
tackle most of the things that C++ offered while getting rid of some of the more tedious tasks that came with the earlier languages.
The fact that technology was become faster while also becoming cheaper meant that new languages needed to be created to keep up with
the faster needs of users. In practice, it was meant to replace C and C++.

## Swift

Swift was created by Apple to be a language that would interact and work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, as well as
the large amount of Objective-C code already written for Apple products, but also to replace the C based language that preceeded
it (such as C, C++, and Objective-C). Swift was created with basic principles in mind: Safety, Speed, and Expressivity. A main issue
that Swift wished to address especially was Safety. In previous languages, it was easy to "hang yourself" so to speak, with problems
such as null pointers and handling callbacks.
